A music player modelled after foobar2000

- GUI is made using [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) 
- Audio is handled by [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio)

(Really I'm just padding this description section to make it look more professional)

I'm working on this to learn Rust and also just practice programming in general.
Some features include: 
- Asynchronous library scanning
- ???THATS IT????
