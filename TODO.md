# Project To-Do / Planning

## Features
- [ ] rym (rateyourmusic) api
- [ ] Rest of playback_bar (next, prev, randnext)
- [ ] Cache/save file list to persist across sessions (sql?)
- [ ] Implement playlist functionality

## Bug Fixes
- [x] Song duration doesn't work

## Improvements
- [ ] Make layout not suck

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for the audio playback module

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Ideas
- [ ] equalizer, visualizer?
- [ ] themes
- [ ] dsp? (maybe too far out of scope of original idea)
- [ ] Something I frequently do in foobar and would like to stop: when I add a
set of songs to the playlist screen, eventually the playlist grows so big that I
have that exact album on the playlist already just farther up/down. So is it
possible to implement some sort of "if album already in playlist, jump to album
in playlist view instead of inserting"
