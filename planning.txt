Gonna see if making a file like this helps my memory/recall of any work I've
done for a later date
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
possible UI components: (we're just copying foobar's functionality since I love it so much)
    playback bar - play/pause/stop/etc.
    volume slider
    song progress
    file/edit/view/playback dropdown menus
    file list display - show albums/artists/whatever sorting
    track metadata
    "playlist" viewer

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
grab song/file metadata
sort functionality by artists/albums alphabetically
search bar for specific string in file

IN PROGRESS:

DONE:
Try mapping over closure to make buttons
